# Modular Puzzle Text Platform

Create custom signs, social media handles, or names with this fully modular text system!

This project consists of individual letters that snap together like puzzle pieces. Just print the letters you need, print the corresponding number of bases, and connect them to spell out anything you want.

### ⚠️ Project Notes & Settings

Please read these tips for the best printing and assembly results:

* **Fusion 360 Source:** The design is parametric, so almost everything is configurable to your needs. *Note: You may see an error warning regarding the extrusion in the timeline; this is a known quirk and can be safely ignored—the model works perfectly.*
* **Slicer Settings:**
* **Infill:** 5% is sufficient.
* **Orientation:** Make sure to **flip the letters and pillars** so they lay flat on the print bed. This ensures strength and a clean surface finish.


* **Printer:** A **0.2mm nozzle** is ideal for this project to ensure the puzzle connectors fit tightly.
* **Assembly:** Depending on your printer's flow calibration, you may need to briefly trim the edges of the connectors or pillars to get a flush fit. Most pillars are interchangeable between letters.
